    "But what do we mean exactly by 'energy'? Let's say the total internal energy of our system is $U$. In electrochemistry, we usually have a fixed temperature $T$ and pressure $p$. We want to exclude the heat and volume work contributions from the environment, so we use the **Gibbs free energy**\n",

    "Equivalently, we can use the chemical potential $\\mu = G/N$, which is just the Gibbs energy per particle. So: **we want to find the phase with the lowest chemical potential at different electrode potentials and pH**.\n",
