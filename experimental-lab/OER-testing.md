# Electrochemical analysis
Now that the catalyst has been formed, it is time to analyze its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in an alkaline environment.

## Task description
Prepare a stock solution of the electrolyte of choice (pH<12!). Use this to characterize the surface in a clean cell (N2 atmosphere., CE: carbon rod, reference electrode (REF): hydroflex).
Cyclic voltammetry (CV): 0.4 – 1.5 V vs. RHE. 50 cycles, 50 mV/s. 
Then, in the same solution, test the catalytic activity with a CV (1.2 – 1.7 V vs. RHE. 10 cycles, 10 mV/s), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV, 1.2 – 1.7 V vs. RHE. 2 mV/s).

Think about how to measure stability accurately between different catalysts.

## Catalyst alternation
The aim of this research is to find out what kind of material preparation leads to an active and stable catalyst. We can change the catalyst composition and loading by altering electrodeposition conditions. We can mix metal salts in different ratios to get a different composition. We can also vary the length and current density of deposition to change the amount of metal oxide deposited on the catalyst. 

## Calcination
The catalyts that we form are formed in water and therefore might be very porous or instable. By heating it up to a high temperature, we can further oxide the catalyst and dry it out. This will likely lead to a different oxygen stoichiometry and structure and might worsen, or improve the activity because of the surface area or because of electronic properties.
