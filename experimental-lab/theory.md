## Electrochemical stability window
_These are the most important reactions that occur on any electrode in aqeous electrolyte._ 

The potentials given are the standard redox potentials for the conversion between H2/O2 <-> H2O. Platinum is a really good catalyst for HER/HOR so the onset for both reactions is respectively <0V and >0V but OER/ORR start at a significant overpotential of at least 0.2 V for the best catalysts.

**1)    Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) @ <0 V vs. RHE**

Acidic:

$$\mathrm{2 H^+ + 2e^-\rightarrow H_2}$$

Alkaline:

$$\mathrm{2 H_2O + 2e^-\rightarrow H_2 + 2 OH^-}$$

**2)	Hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) @ >0 V vs. RHE**

What are the reactions for acidic and alkaline conditions?

**3) Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) @ >>1.23 V vs. RHE**

Acidic:

$$\mathrm{2 H_2O\rightarrow O_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^-}$$

Alkaline

Hint, it involves OH-
