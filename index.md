## Report instructions

* Combine the theory and experiment parts into one measurement report
* For instructions on the report, see Brightspace
* The most important goal of the report is that someone else can understand and reproduce your measurements and calculations
* For examples on how to combine theory and experiment into one report, see {cite:t}`diaz2015guidelines`. Your introduction can be much shorter than the one in a scientific paper
* Going through several iterations of feedback and rewriting will give you the best result. You can get feedback from your colleagues, or ask the TAs for early feedback
