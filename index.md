## Research questions

| Teams | Research question |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Team 1** |     How does the activity of different heterogeneous catalysts depend on the precise acid concentration in an acidic regime? |
| **Team 2** |     How does the activity of the heterogeneous catalysts depend on the presence of cations under alkaline conditions? |
| **Team 3** |     How does the activity of the porphyrin catalysts depend on the   amount of catalytic material? |
| **Team 4** |     How does the activity of the porphyrin catalysts depend on the   metal site?|
| **Team 5** |     How does the activity of the porphyrin catalysts depend on the pH?|
| **Team 6** |     How does the activity of the different heterogeneous catalysts   depend on the precise base concentration under alkaline conditions? |
| **Team 7** |     How does the activity of the different heterogeneous catalysts   depend on the buffer constitution under relative neutral conditions?  |


## Report instructions
For the report:

* The report should describe all parts (DFT, EChem, Photo, STM). Make sure to keep the structure of introduction (why)/methods (how)/results/conclusion for each experiment. You can, for example, make a different section for each experiment.
* Your research question is mostly related to the electrochemistry experiments. Try to answer this question in the electrochemistry section.
* Not all parts are closely related. Some of them are. Try to relate as many as you can, for example in the discussion/conclusion of your electrochemistry section.
* The report should be around 10 pages, so a good rule of thumb is one page per day.


For the presentation or poster:

* Choose the results you like and make an interesting story out of it. This means you are allowed to leave out results.
