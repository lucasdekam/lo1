```{admonition} Learning goals 
:class: tip
After this lab course you should be able to...

* make electrolyte solutions
* assemble an electrochemical cell with an electrocatalyst in a three-electrode setup
* investigate the effect of electrolyte and catalyst composition on the oxygen evolution reaction 
* work cleanly and precisely in an electrochemistry lab
* analyze your results with a critical view. To do this, you should compare your methods and results to scientific publications (some publications can be found in the reference lists on the pages of the respective projects)
```

## Practical information
The practical lab is CM2.26 on the 2nd floor. There are lockers in the hallway to store your bags and jackets which are accessible with your LU card. A lab coat and suitable goggles are required at all times. Personal items except for food are allowed in the lab. Please bring your own lab journal and a laptop.

Normal days are from 9:00 - 17:00 but some days there are deviations. On June 18th from 9:00-12:00 there is a EC group meeting from the group of prof. Marc Koper. You are free to join the meeting or work on your report/presentation/poster outside the lab.

In the third week you are free to work on your presentation and report. We will be around to provide feedback, we will let you know how to contact us.


## Layout electrochemistry lab schedule
**Day 1**
_The goal on the first day is to prepare as much as possible for the experiments on day 2 - 5 and it serves as an introduction to the field of electrochemistry._  We will try to do the following things on day 1: 
- Clean glassware
- Perform safety analysis chemicals (and gases) and experiments
- Develop research/experimental plan
- Read literature
- Install IviumSoft 

**Day 2**
- Prepare electrolyte solutions
- Perform electrocatalyst depositions
- Prepare samples for characterization and experimentation

**Day 3 - 5** 
Measure activity, stability and characterization of catalysts. Some groups will make more samples than others and some will do more spectroscopy. The spectroscopy will be done throughout the week in agreement with the supervisor.
