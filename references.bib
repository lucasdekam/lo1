abstract = {The oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) is pivotal in many energy-conversion technologies as it is an important counter reaction to others that convert stable chemicals to higher-value products using electrochemistry. The local microenvironment and pH for the anode OER can vary from acidic to neutral to alkaline depending on the system being explored, making definitive mechanistic insights difficult. In this paper, we couple experiments, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, microkinetics, and transport modeling to explore the entire pH range of the OER. At low current densities, neutral pH values unexpectedly perform better than the acidic and alkaline conditions, and this trend is reversed at higher current densities (> 20 mA cm−2). Using multiscale modeling, this switch is rationalized by a change from a dual-reaction mechanism to a single rate-determining step. The model also shows how the alkaline reaction rates dominate in the middle to high pH range. Furthermore, we explore that the local pH for near-neutral conditions is much different (e.g., 2.4 at the reaction surface vs. 9 in the bulk) than the pH extremes, demonstrating the criticality that transport phenomena plays in kinetic activity.}

abstract = {High entropy alloys are made by mixing five or more elements at equal or nearly equal atomic ratios. They have demonstrated significant interests in many fields. However, due to the short time of their development, many HEAs fields have not been studied in sufficient depth. Surprisingly, HEAs have achieved significant results in the field of functional materials, especially in serving as an oxygen evolution reaction catalyst for electrochemical water cracking. The complex surface environment of HEAs and the multi-metal synergistic effect give HEAs excellent OER catalytic properties. In addition, some high entropy derivatives have also been demonstrated as excellent OER catalysts. This review describes the current research status and great potential of HEAs and high entropy derivatives as OER catalysts. The development of high entropy alloys and two OER mechanisms are summarized. This includes a systematic analysis of how the various parameters influence the catalysis performance including the surface morphology, synthesis strategies and OER properties of HEAs as well as high-entropy derivatives. HEAs with the same synthesis strategy are summarized, as well as the application of DFT calculations to HEAs. This article provides some insights and possible solutions regarding the construction of reliable HEA as OER catalysis. Finally, insights are offered on the future directions and prospects in the field of HEA catalysts.}
